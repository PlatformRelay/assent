# assent

> **Status: pre-alpha / design phase.** All APIs, schemas, and commands are drafts.

**assent** is a deterministic, policy-driven **auto-merge gate** for self-service
configuration repositories. Drop it into a repo's CI pipeline and it turns merge requests /
pull requests into decisions: **approve, comment, request changes, or block** — based on
rules *you* write in a **Kyverno-style declarative YAML** with CEL predicates (a Rego
escape hatch is designed and unlocks with the first consumer who needs it — D-012).

The goal: make any config repo automerge-capable with deterministic, testable, reviewable
rules — without writing a custom bot per repo.

## Why

Most changes to config repos (topic definitions, service catalogs, tfvars, tenant onboarding
files) are routine: a team edits *their own* entries within safe bounds. Yet a human still has
to review every MR, reconstructing the same context each time — what changed, who owns it, is
it destructive, which policy applies. assent encodes that reasoning as policy so the routine
90% merges itself and reviewers spend their attention on the risky 10%.

## What it does (intended scope)

- **Runs in the pipeline** — GitLab CI in v1; GitHub Actions is a designed seam that unlocks
  per D-012. One process per MR/PR, no long-lived service required.
- **Understands structured changes** — parses JSON, YAML, and HCL/tfvars into a canonical
  change model (field-level adds / modifies / deletes), so policies reason about *semantics*,
  not diff lines.
- **Policies in Rego or declarative YAML** — both frontends compile to the same decision
  engine; pick whichever your team reads best.
- **Pluggable permission & fact providers** — "is the author allowed to touch this entry?"
  can be answered by Keycloak, LDAP, GitLab/GitHub group membership, a CODEOWNERS-style file,
  or your own plugin.
- **Acts like a reviewer** — posts findings as resolvable review threads, comments,
  approves/denies, and (when everything is green) merges. Same behaviour on GitLab and GitHub.
- **Testable by design** — repo owners get a test harness: fixture changes in, expected
  decision out. Policies without tests are a lint error, not a style choice.

[`docs/planning/meta-plan.md`](docs/planning/meta-plan.md) for how we get from here to a
precise implementation plan.

Spec/test-driven, gates in the [`Taskfile`](Taskfile.yml):

```bash
task check   # fmt + vet + lint + test
```
