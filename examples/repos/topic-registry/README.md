# topic-registry — sample self-service repo (YAML, one file per topic)

Fully generic, generated sample (D-002 — nothing here is copied from any private codebase).
It models the most common self-service shape: a **message-topic registry** where each topic
is one YAML file and teams request changes via merge request.

## Governed workflow

1. A team edits (or adds) *their* topic file under `topics/<env>/<topic-name>.yaml`.
2. They open a merge request; CI runs the merge gate against the policy set.
3. Routine changes — a partition bump within quota on a topic the author's team owns —
   are vouched and auto-merged. Everything else gets an explained review thread.

Entry semantics: `owner` names the owning team (resolved against a permission provider);
`partitions` may only grow, within quota; `retention_hours` is bounded per environment;
deleting a topic file is always a human-review event.

## Layout

```
topics/
  prod/   # stricter thresholds, no destructive automerge
  dev/    # looser bounds for experimentation
```

## Rule archetypes exercised (docs/vision.md)

- **Ownership** — `owner` field per entry; author must belong to the owning team.
- **Bounded change** — `partitions` may increase up to quota, never decrease;
  `retention_hours` within a per-env band.
- **No destruction** — removing a topic file (or a whole entry) requires human review.
- **Environment split** — `topics/prod/**` vs `topics/dev/**` paths.
- **Schema validity** — every file must keep the topic schema valid.
