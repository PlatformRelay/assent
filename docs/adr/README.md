# Architecture Decision Records

Format: see [`template.md`](template.md). Numbered, immutable once **Accepted** (supersede,
don't edit). Lifecycle: draft → **Accepted** → (`Superseded by ADR-nnnn`).

Design-phase records are firmed up via trade-off matrices and spikes in the planning
workflow (see [`../planning/meta-plan.md`](../planning/meta-plan.md)).
**Phase-2 gate (P2-E5, 2026-07-21):** ADR-0002–0017 Accepted — evidence in
[`../planning/adr-acceptance-review.md`](../planning/adr-acceptance-review.md); partial
supersessions by ADR-0016/0017 are noted on each ADR's status line (not full
`Superseded by` replacements).
