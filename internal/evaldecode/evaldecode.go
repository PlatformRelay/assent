// Package evaldecode is the E2-S04 REQ-06 boundary that turns the LIVE differ's
// output into the engine's typed EvaluationInput. It lives OUTSIDE internal/core,
// so it may import internal/change and internal/core/aggregate while internal/core
// stays forge/change-free (TestCorePurity / TestEvaluationIsProviderless).
//
// It was extracted from cmd/assent (P5-E6-S01) so both the `assent` CLI shell AND
// the pure internal/adoptertest test-harness library reuse ONE canonical decoder —
// the load-bearing fail-open fix below must never be duplicated (drift would
// reopen it). cmd/assent keeps thin lowercase wrappers delegating here.
//
// THE FAIL-OPEN THIS CLOSES. internal/change emits change.Change.Old/New as
// CANONICAL, TAG-DISCRIMINATING STRINGS (see internal/change/diff.go render):
//
//	!!int / !!float  -> the RAW literal            ("12", "6", "016")
//	!!bool           -> the raw literal            ("true", "false")
//	!!null           -> "null"
//	!!str            -> JSON-QUOTED                 (the string "12" -> "\"12\"")
//	absent side      -> ""                          (add has no old; delete no new)
//
// The E2 engine (aggregate.evalLeaf / toCEL) does TYPED compares: the D-016
// `partitions-must-not-shrink` rule is the bare `new >= old`, no int() coercion.
// If the raw canonical string were fed straight into EvalChange.Old/New, cel-go
// would bind two STRINGS and `new >= old` would become a LEXICAL compare — and
// lexically "6" >= "12" is TRUE, so a partition shrink 12->6 would be judged
// non-destructive and APPROVE. That is the exact forbidden outcome. DecodeCanonical
// INVERTS the render so a numeric literal becomes a json.Number, which toCEL binds
// as int64/float64 (a numeric compare), restoring the correct 6 >= 12 -> false.
//
// Fail-safe direction (GUIDELINES §2): a value that cannot be decoded must NEVER
// silently become a lexical string. A numeric literal always becomes a json.Number
// (typed); an absent/undecodable value becomes nil (a numeric/relational compare
// over nil ERRORS in cel-go -> the engine's tri-state fail-safe -> REVIEW), never a
// permissive string.
//
// WHAT THIS PACKAGE DOES NOT CLOSE (and where that is closed). Decoding cannot be
// the whole answer, because a value that is GENUINELY text stays text: a YAML
// `partitions: "12"` is a !!str and this package keeps it the Go string "12" by
// design (the differ deliberately distinguishes it from the number 12). CEL then
// binds a string, and CEL's < <= > >= are DEFINED over strings as a lexical
// compare — so before D-129 the D-016 `new >= old` over a quoted shrink 12->6
// answered the lexical "6" >= "12" = TRUE and the shrink APPROVEd. Decoding could
// not prevent that; only the evaluator can. Since D-129 the engine seam refuses
// it: aggregate's textOrderGuard makes any relational compare whose operand
// actually evaluates to text an evaluation ERROR -> predicate.error -> REVIEW.
// The two layers are complementary and BOTH load-bearing — this package makes a
// numeric literal compare numerically (BLOCK, the right answer); the guard makes
// a genuinely-textual operand fail safe (REVIEW) instead of answering wrongly.

// DecodeCanonical inverts internal/change's canonical render back to the typed

//
//   - "" / "null"     -> nil (an absent add/delete side, or an explicit null).
//   - a !!bool literal -> the bool. go-yaml resolves true/True/TRUE and
//     false/False/FALSE as !!bool (YAML-1.2 core, resolve.go), and the differ's
//     render emits the RAW literal — so all six spellings are matched. Without the
//     capitalized spellings a bool-field ordering rule (`new >= old`) would decode
//     "True"/"False" to json.Number, fall to a lexical STRING compare, and mis-order.
//   - `"..."`         -> the unquoted string (a !!str value; stays a STRING so a
//     numeric rule over it does NOT numeric-compare it — the differ deliberately
//     kept a string "12" distinct from the number 12. An ORDERING rule over that
//     string does not compare it lexically either: since D-129 the evaluator
//     refuses to order text and fails safe to REVIEW).
//   - anything else   -> json.Number(literal) (a numeric literal, bound typed by
//     toCEL). Every bool (all six emitted spellings), JSON-quoted string, and null
//     is handled ABOVE, so the fallthrough is exactly a numeric literal — never a
//     capitalized bool and never a raw string.
//
// LIMITATION (the ADR-0013 residual #1 the evaluator owns, not the decoder): a
// numeric literal larger than int64 flows through as json.Number and toCEL binds
// it as float64 — a LOSSY compare, which is still live: two distinct literals
// beyond 2^53 can compare equal. What is no longer live is the second half of the
// old wording, "or its string form": since D-129 a literal representable as
// NEITHER int64 nor float64 (beyond ~1.8e308) binds a CEL error value, so it can
// never be ordered as text; it fails safe instead. DecodeCanonical itself is
// unchanged — it preserves the literal faithfully and leaves the edge to toCEL.
