# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Release notes are generated from gitmoji-conventional commits on the default branch using
[git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/).

## Compatibility notes

Long-lived notes for consumers of released artifacts. They live in `cliff.toml`'s changelog
header because `CHANGELOG.md` is regenerated in full from commit history and a hand-edit here
would be silently overwritten by the next `task changelog-write`.

- **`pins.toolDigest` changes value after `v0.1.0` (D-120).** DecisionRecords emitted by
`v0.1.0` and earlier pin `toolDigest` as sha256 over the *tool version string*, so every
build stamped with the same version shared one digest; records carrying that derivation are
identifiable by exactly it. Builds after D-120 derive `toolDigest` from the binary's
canonical Go build info instead (main module path/version/sum, dependency checksums, VCS
revision and dirty flag), falling back to `sha256("buildinfo-unavailable\n" + toolVersion)`
when that build info is absent or does not identify the main module's content (no module sum
and no VCS revision — `go build -buildvcs=false`, test binaries). The field, its type and the
frozen `v1alpha1` schema are
unchanged — records published with `v0.1.0` remain schema-valid — but the *value* is not
comparable across the boundary: a mismatch between a pre-D-120 and a post-D-120 record means
"derived differently", not "different build".

- **Every `replayBundleDigest` changes value after `v0.1.0` (D-121).** The comparison corpus
published at `v0.1.0` pins each case with an undomained `sha256:<hex>` over the re-marshalled
bundle. D-121 codifies the byte-vs-document split: a `ReplayBundle` is a schema-owned JSON
*document* that consumers re-parse and re-verify, so its digest is now the domain-separated
`assent-jcs-v1` digest — canonical JSON hashed under the replay-bundle schema `$id`
(ADR-0017 §9) — rendered as bare lowercase hex with no `sha256:` tag, because the value is no
longer sha256 over bytes and must not claim to be. Digests over BYTE artifacts are unaffected
and stay raw `sha256:<hex>`: `pins.policySha`, `pins.toolDigest`, and the ADR-0019 marker
occurrence/decision digests. **Action required if you pinned, cached, or recomputed a
`replayBundleDigest`: regenerate it.** A stale pin does not silently pass — `assent compare
--suite` rejects it with a fail-closed digest mismatch before any evaluation runs. The corpus
identity itself is unchanged: no `caseId` was reused or retired and no bundle byte changed, so
D-113 immutability holds — only the algorithm computing the pin moved, versioned by D-121.
